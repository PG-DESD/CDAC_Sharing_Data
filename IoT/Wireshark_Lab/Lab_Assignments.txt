Download the Wiresharkintro.pcapng for this lab using the link below and try to answer the following questions. 
Some of the questions are easier to find, some might take some research. 
The point is to get some hands-on with Wireshark.

Questions for this assignment
Q1. How many packets were captured in this trace file?

Q2. What protocol does packet number 8 contain? (The highest-layer protocol)

Q3. If you just installed Wireshark for the first time, what is the name of the profile you are using? (bottom right corner)

Q4. Look at packet number one - what is the source IP address in this packet?

Q5. What is the source TCP port in this same packet?

Q6. Which TCP flag is set in this packet?

Q7. What is the frame number of the next packet in this TCP conversation?

Q8. Can you set a filter for this TCP conversation? How many packets do you get?

Q9. Create your Own Profile and Set Layout Pane3 as Packet Diagram?

Q10. Add a coloring rule that will make your tcp FIN packets blue. What filter will you use to do that? 

Q11. Select packet number 1 Can you find the TCP segment length? Add this value as a column.

Common Filters
IPv4 Address -> ip.addr==10.0.0.1
IPv4 Source -> ip.src==10.0.0.1
IPv4 Destination -> ip.dst==10.0.0.1
IPv4 Range(Subnet) -> ip.addr==10.0.0.0/24
TCP Port -> tcp.port==80
TCP SYN -> tcp.flags.syn==1

Capture filters are applied when we are bringing packets, 
into our capture buffer & Display filters are applied after the that.

Filtering According to Subnet
192.168.10.20/8 = 192.x.x.x
192.168.10.20/16= 192.168.x.x
192.168.10.20/24= 192.168.10.x


Operators in Filters
==   !   ||   &&   >   <
eq  not  or   and  gt  lt

Example : ip.addr eq 192.168.1.1 && tcp

Spl. Filters
1. Contains (exact string)
eg: frame contains admin

2. in{range}
tcp.port in {80 443 8000..8004}

3. matches(regex)[case insensitive]
http.host matches "\.(org|com|net)"

Q1. How many ARP packets are in the trace file?
Q2. How many HTTP packets contain word "Php"? (Regardless of case)
Q3. Set a filter for TCP port 80. How many packets meet that filter?
Q4. How many packets are in the top(Bytes Transfer) IP conversation? Set a filter for this conversation.
[Hint: Statistics->Conversations]
Q5. How many packets have the SYN Flag bit set?
Q6. How many TCP Resets (flag) are in the pcap?
Q7. How many packets coming from the 10.0.2.15 station?

Server Client
Focus on packet number two of client file and answer the following questions. 
Q1. What is the destination MAC address? (Use format xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx

Q2. What is the source MAC in this packet?

Q3. What is the IP identification number? (Use format xxxxxx with no commas)

Q4. What is the IP Time To Live?

Q5. What is the Source IP?

Q6. Now change pcaps to the server side. Open server-slowfiledownload.pcapng. Which packet corresponds to the packet we were analyzing on the client side? What is the frame number?

Q7. Focus on this frame. What is the source MAC?

Q8. What is the destination MAC?

Q9. What is the IP ID?

Q10. What is the IP TTL?

Q11. How many routers did this packet go through?

Q12. Was there a NAT (Network Address Translation) along the path? Y/N

Fragmentation
Q1. Ping Google.com and Trace it via wireshark , check for TTL to get no of routers in the path?

Q2. Analyse ping-fragmentation.pcap file see how frame split when size exceeds 1500 bytes?

Q3. Check Flags "More Fragment" in IPv4 and Does IP ID Changes when Frames are Fragmented Note your Observations?

Spoofing/DDoS Attack
A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, 
service or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic.

Q1. How many unique IP hosts do we see in this pcap?

Q2. How many packets are in the top IP conversation?

Q3. What country is the 62.189.238.32 endpoint communicating from? (Full country name)

Q4. Can you work out how to filter the hosts coming from Turkey? How many packets do you find after filtering for Turkey? (hint: ip.geoip.src_country==?)

Q5. Look at packet 1 - what is the IP TTL for this packet?

Q6. What is the IP Identification number for this packet?

Q7. Look at packet 7, which appears to be coming from the same subnet. What is the IP Identification number?

Q8. Add IP TTL as a column and filter for all packets coming FROM the 212.252.0.0/16 subnet ranges. (Enter OK as the answer)

Q9. Does the IP TTL change for any of these packets? Y/N

Q10. Add the IP ID as a column. Does the IP ID change for any of these packets? Y/N

Q11. Do you think these packets could be spoofed IP's? Y/N
