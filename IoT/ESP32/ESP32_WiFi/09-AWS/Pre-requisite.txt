What's the Difference Between Roles and Policies in AWS?
The difference between IAM roles and policies in AWS is that
a role is a type of IAM identity that can be authenticated and 
authorized to utilize an AWS resource, 
whereas a policy defines the permissions of the IAM identity.

1. Create IOT All Access Policy in AWS
AWS_Console->IAM->AccessManagement->Policies->Create Policy
Select Service IoT
Actions : All IoT actions (iot:*)
Resources: All resources

2. Create IoT Core Access Policies
AWS_Console->Iot_Core->Security->Policies->Create Policy
Policy name: <name>
Policy effect:Allow
Policy action:*
Policy resource:*

3. Create IoT Core Access Certificate
AWS_Console->Iot_Core->Security->Certificate->Add Certificate->Create Certificate
Auto-generate new certificate (recommended)
Certificate status: Active

Only 3 Certificates are Required
